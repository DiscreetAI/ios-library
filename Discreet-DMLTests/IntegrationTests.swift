         Test general integration of library components.

         Here is a list of things that are not tested here:
         - Communication Manager communication (we shouldn't rely on cloud node for testing, and yet there isn't a simple way of setting up a local test server)
         - MPS (Cocoapods does not support all dependencies for Mac Catalyst, so we must only test on iOS, and we don't have a physical iOS device yet).
         - Downloading the converted model from a cloud node instead of just S3 (Again shouldn't rely on cloud node for testing)
